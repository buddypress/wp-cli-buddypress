Quick links: [Installing](#installing) | [Support](#support)

## Installing

The `wp-cli-buddypress` comes installed by default with BuddyPress. So if you need to use the latest version, run:

```bash
wp package install git@github.com:buddypress/wp-cli-buddypress.git
```

In many cases the default memory limit will not be enough to run composer so running the following instead is generally recommended:

```bash
php -d memory_limit=512M "$(which wp)" package install git@github.com:buddypress/wp-cli-buddypress.git
```
